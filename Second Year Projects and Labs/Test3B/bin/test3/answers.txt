There are two cell number object created. One  CellNumber object is created by the client , and the  other is created by the constructor because cellphone is a composition of CellNumber

C.  List<CellNumber>  CN =  new ArrayList<CellNumber>();
	for  ( CellNumber C : callLog)
	{
		CN.add(new CellNumber(c))
	}
	return CN;
	
	D. 		new calls get added to the end of the list
	
			Modifying the returned list has no effect on the CellPhone because it is a new list. it is impossible to to modify the CEllNumbers in the class because CellNumber is immutable . 
			Since the CallLog cannot be modified and neither can the CellNumbers, a shallow copy is enough to keep the invariants true
			
	E. 		if x.compareTo(y) == 0 then x.equals(Y) == true;
			if x.equals(y) == true then x.compareTo(Y) == 0;
			
		b. because both CompareTo and equals use the same fielss to perform the comparison
